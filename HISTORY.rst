Changelog
---------

7.6.0 (----------)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Include tri.struct 4.x as possible requirement


7.5.0 (2020-04-24)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Upped dependency tri.declarative to 5.x



7.4.0 (2020-01-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix name attribute on submit action on edit_or_create forms to work with form.is_target() when the form has a name


7.3.1 (2019-12-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* You can now customize the ajax dispatch page size by setting `extra__endpoint_page_size` on a field

* Removed validation on `endpoint_dispatch_prefix` because in some cases we do want them to be out of sync (tri.table does this for example)


7.3.0 (2019-12-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Field` was missing the `@with_meta` decorator

* `newforms` class on `Form` removed. It was turned on by mistake due to some heritage from the code base tri.form was extracted from.

* Fixed an issue where overriding a Field didn't work when creating a form from a model

* Use select2 by default for `choice_queryset`

* Missing `UUIDField` factory

* You can now override field properties like this: `MyForm(field__foo__query__show=True)`

7.2.4 (2019-10-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Treat actions dicts as Namespaces


7.2.3 (2019-10-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed deprecation warnings


7.2.2 (2019-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug where `Action` was functionally bound to `Form`, but it should be generally useful (e.g. for tri.table).

* Fixed a bug with `Field.icon` where there was a missing space when using the `icon_classes` argument, causing garbled css classes.


7.2.1 (2019-10-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug where non-named forms did not perform validation because they didn't find the `/` POST key. They shouldn't need that!


7.2.0 (2019-10-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add support for setting name on forms to be able to reuse field names between two forms in the same view

* Removed deprecated `render_css_classes`, `render_container_css_classes`, `render_label_container_css_classes` and `render_input_container_css_classes`

* Fixed various issues with the namespacing necessary to have multiple forms on one page.

* Introduced `actions`/`Action` that will replace `links`/`Link`.

* Deprecated `links`/`Link`.

* `create_or_edit_object` now has an overridable parameter `on_valid_post`.


7.1.0 (2019-09-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added declared_fields to `Form`.


7.0.0 (2019-06-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Renamed package from `tri.form` to `tri_form`. This is a breaking change

* Dropped python2 support

* Dropped Django < 2.0 support


6.0.2 (2019-06-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed the default value for `parse_emtpy_string_as_none` to be based on the model fields `null` property.

* `from_model` should not overwrite defaults too early

* `Field.choice` now has a sane default parser using `choice_to_option`

* Changed render_attrs to stop you from making some common mistakes

* Fixed `time_render_value()`

* Fixes and improved tests for from_model_expand

* Fixed `from_model` for Django `TextField`. Should be `Field.textarea`, not `Field.text`


6.0.1 (2019-05-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed cases where from_model lost the type when inheriting


6.0.0 (2019-04-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make `Field` shortcuts compatible with subclassing. Previous fix didn't work all the way.

* Use the new major tri.declarative, and update to follow the new style of class member shortcuts

* Major fixes to how `from_model` works. Subclassing `Form` and `Field` now works like you'd expect. This is a breaking change.

* Removed `Field.comma_separated` shortcut. This was never used, and poorly tested.

5.4.0 (2019-04-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make `Field` shortcuts compatible with subclassing


5.3.1 (2019-03-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix that Django's DoesNotExist events don't leak out of the field-validation code


5.3.0 (2019-02-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you subclass Form this custom class is now used properly in the `from_model` code paths

* `Form` now has a refinable attribute `field_class` which you should use to point to your `Field` subclass if you have one. This is best accomplished in the `Meta` class on the class inheriting from `Form`.

* Added `Form.create_or_edit_object` that will respect your subclass if you have one.


5.2.2 (2019-01-28)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed escaping bug introduced in 5.2.0: You could get a KeyError crash if you had `{` and `}` in attributes.


5.2.1 (2019-01-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed coverage build (this also broke the travis build and as a consequence the pypi release process)


5.2.0 (2019-01-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Rendering of submit button is now a `Link` and you can now supply your own buttons and links here.

* Fixed crash in rendering fields in some cases. This was due to an incorrect use of `format_html`.

* Flask and Jinja2 support

* Updated examples for modern django, and added an example

* Modernize attrs rendering on Field (this introduces a few deprecations)

* render_attrs support for style attributes. This means you can now do `Link(attrs__style__display='none')` for example.


5.1.1 (2018-10-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* File field tried to render the binary contents on form validation errors. This is a crash in Django 2.1

* `from_model` was broken when traversing a foreign key relation with `__`


5.1.0 (2018-10-09)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Dropped Django 1.8 support

5.0.5 (2018-04-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix form submit link rendering.


5.0.4 (2017-10-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Revert new default parser on `Field.choice`.


5.0.3 (2017-10-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Improve default parser implementation on `Field.choice`. A reasonable implementation of `__str__` is enough for objects in `choices`.

* Fix evaluation order so that `Field.initial`/`Field.initial_list` is available when fields are evaluated. (`Field.show` is still invoked early)


5.0.2 (2017-10-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Field.from_model` produced incorrect parser for foreign keys.


5.0.1 (2017-09-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Changed `label` on `Field` to `display_name`. This is in line with tri.query and tri.table.

* `Field.choice` incorrectly handles post_validation (fixes github issue #9)

* `Form` now doesn't try to read initial data and form data from Fields that are show=False

* `create_or_edit_object` doesn't take a parameter `render_context` anymore, use `render__context`

* You no longer need to specify the `model` parameter to `choice_queryset` or `multi_choice_queryset` if you give it a `QuerySet` as `choices` (as opposed to giving a callable)

* `Field.choice_queryset` and `Field.multi_choice_queryset` now reevaluates the QuerySet on each usage (fixes tri.table github issue 16)


4.10.1 (2017-06-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bugfix: `on_save` callback for `create_or_edit_object` was missing `form` parameter

* Fixed bug where raw_data was sent to render_value when there was an error on the field


4.6.0 (2017-03-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Field` class now inherits from `object`, making the implementation more pythonic.
  (Attributes still possible to override in constructor call, see `NamespaceAwareObject`)

* Added `Form.extra` namespace for custom data.


4.5.0 (2016-12-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    form = Form.from_model(field__foo__class=Form.integer)

* The incorrectly named parameter `db_field` to `Form.fields_from_model` has been renamed to the correct `field`.

* The parameter `db_field` to `create_members_from_model` has been renamed to `member_params_by_member_name`.

* Better logic for figuring out which mode we're in when POST-ing

* Allow `None` as `endpoint_dispatch_prefix`.


3.8.0 (2016-09-12)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Field.datetime is more forgiving in the formats it receives: it will not accept ISO8601 formats but missing seconds or seconds+minutes

3.0.0 (2016-05-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Parse modes introduced. This fixes validation of partially submitted forms, using tri.form for filters and other problems.

* Refactored to use tri.declarative @dispatch

* Added __field__ endpoint handling. This is useful for e.g. loading choices with ajax instead of up front.

* Form.errors is now a set

* views.create_object/edit_object/create_or_edit_object now default parameter `render` to render_to_response instead of render_to_string. This is a potential braking change.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Datetime fields used to not roundtrip cleanly via the form (they output
  milliseconds then failed on parsing them) Field.file didn't exist.

* Changed syntax for specifying html attributes and classes. They are now use
  the same way of addressing as other things, e.g.:
  Field.choice(attrs__foo="bar", attrs__class__baz=True) will yield something
